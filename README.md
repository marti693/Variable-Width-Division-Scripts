# Variable-Width-Division-Scripts
Scripts to create variable width divider in using multiple division algorithms. Dividers are in Verilog, and designed for FPGA

The Trireme soft processor is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xA7PwfwYtpmFyHWQq3qDps4Oj8-3vS6A/view?usp=sharing
This zip file includes:
All verilog files used in the processor design
All quartus projects synthesized in the python project
All batch scripts used in the python project
The location for all of the outputs from the python project

Important note for use:
There are many locations that have a fully qualified path that need to be changed to match your paths.
Files that include a fully qualified path include:
simulation.bat
synthesis.bat
synthesis2.bat
Parser.py
VMH.py
VerilogSynthesis.py
